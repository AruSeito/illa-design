      A design is a plan or specification for the
      construction of an object or system or for the
      implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype,
      product or process. The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design.
      In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some
      engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity.
    </Heading>
  </Typography>
