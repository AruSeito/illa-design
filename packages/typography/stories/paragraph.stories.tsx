    implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype,
    product or process. The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design. In some cases, the direct
    construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and
    graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity.</Paragraph>
